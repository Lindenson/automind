"""The acquisition engine's public interface (spec 011, contracts/acquire.md).

The only engine module the chat (`automind.application`, `automind.orchestration`, `automind.domain`) may import
(FR-005, FR-006). The chat orders data here — "these kinds of data for this car, by this deadline" — and receives
values with confidence and sources, and for gaps the sources tried. Live calls run in the caller's process within
the caller's deadline and budget (research R5); background work runs in the worker. Everything else under
`automind.acquisition` is internal. Functions are added here only, task by task.
